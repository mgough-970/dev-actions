# Example conceptual workflow for actions on merge to main branch
# This file is illustrative. The actual JupyterBook build and deployment
# is handled by a separate workflow (like the provided jupyterbook_build.yml)
# that triggers on push to the main branch.

# Note:
# To enable the JupyterBook publishing process:
# 1. Ensure you have a workflow file in your repository's .github/workflows/ directory
#    (e.g., copied from this project's .github/workflows/jupyterbook_build.yml or a similar one).
# 2. That workflow should be configured to trigger on pushes to your main branch.
# 3. It will then check out the 'gh-storage' branch for executed notebooks and build
#    the JupyterBook, deploying it to GitHub Pages.
#
# This example file (`notebook-publish-main.yml`) is just a conceptual guide.
# The actual publishing is driven by the presence and configuration of the
# JupyterBook building workflow itself in the target repository.
